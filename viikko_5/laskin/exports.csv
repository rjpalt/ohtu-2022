**Introduction**


Specific lifts are designed to medical emergency operation when requested. In a case of emergency there is key switch in landing used to activate medical emergency mode. Other option is to use access card for activation. Designed lift cancels all calls, stop receiving new calls and travels non-stop to call level.

**Feature activation**


Medical emergency is activated by dedicated switch at landing (or with access card in hall station). For car control authorized user must activate lift operation switch in lift cabinet or use access card.


Deactivation is done by authorized user turning off the switch in lift cabinet.

**Introduction**


“Car to lobby” is specific customer requirement needed for Merdeka 118 delivery.


With this feature authorized user can separate one lift using central command station to serve specific need until car-to-lobby mode is turned off by author. With this feature car is called to desired floor to wait next procedure by user (e.g other auxiliary feature to be used, like attendant service, independent service, etc).

**Feature activation**


Car to lobby mode is activated/deactivated by authorized user at central command station


 


**Description**


 Basic scenario (""independent operation"")


* Car to lobby mode is activated by authorized user at central command station
* When mode is on, multipurpose display above lift entrance is blank
* Allocated lift for “car to lobby” serves all existing calls first, then returns to requested floor.
* Once the selected car has arrived, the car shall open its doors if so selected in advance.  If lift doors remains closed they can be opened remotely by a command at central command station.
* In car touch screen buttons are visible after lift has arrived to requested floor. Passenger makes car call using in-car touch screen.
* Lift drives non-stop to destination floor and opens doors
* Lift serves in independent mode until released from central command station (not any timeout ?)

* Once the selected car has arrived, the car shall open its doors if so selected in advance.  If lift doors remains closed they can be opened remotely by a command at central command station.
* Car remains in the selected floor waiting user to activate any other auxiliary feature (e.g. independent service, attendant service, VIP,etc ).
* in car-controls inside the car are inactive until other auxiliary feature is activated by the authorized user inside the cab (In car operation become activate according to other auxiliary feature specification).


 


Other requirements


* Note other requirements specified in VT-specification, to determine that the lower deck is empty.
* For Lift T19, car-to-lobby operation shall include the ability to bring the upper-deck to L1
* When actuated at the central command station, the car selected shall make a trip to selected location, **unless** it is operating under another auxiliary operation, in which case the car shall travel to the selected location when it is removed from such auxiliary operation while car-to-lobby is still activated.
* E-link must have remote controls to open the doors.

"
KCE - AES,Epic,antti.luonsinen@kone.com,E-20783,,"**KCE Lift marked this for 21Q2**


**KCEGC marked this for Future**


 


Also known as sabbatical feature. See [Feature Book/AES](https://confluence.kone.cbyte.fi/x/b4Wd).


When lift is in AES mode it drives automatically between floors. Lift generates always a car call for next stop.


High level support needed from group controller:


* When all lifts in group are in AES service all landing call buttons should be inactive (or all the time active depending on the configuration). Inactive means here that no light are turned on even when pressed. Active means that button lights are all the time ON. This needs group controller support. Group controller knows the status of all lifts.
* When lift is in AES mode it can also serve landing calls. AES mode affects lift door times (e.g. at main floor 180s, other floors 15s, doors using slower speed). If there are other lifts in group in normal mode they can serve normal calls much faster. Group controller allocation logic needs some fine tuning.

"LCE - Simultaneous parallel run prevention, SPP",Epic,antti.luonsinen@kone.com,E-24331,,"**Introduction**


To avoid so called piston effect there has to be mechanism to avoid parallel start of elevators in the same lift group (same shaft) in certain conditions. Adjustable control must be build to tune needed parameters based on actual site condition/analyzes later on.

**Feature activation**


Feature is always active in selected lift groups, needed parameters are adjustable.


 


**Description**


If two elevators would dispatch from the same floor, system shall avoid this two elevators starting at the same time, to delay one elevator to start after a period of time of the first elevator, because it will avoid the piston effect.  The delay time would be determined by contractor after the analysis, but it is adjustable in future according to actual site condition.

			* Possibility to do testing (test setup exists), not large testing impact
	+ Comments:
		- Signalization types
			* KDS needed, if A-process, then all signalization would be needed, but KDS priority (KNS also has priority over others)
		- Changes needed at least because ATS HK needs to include possibility to by-pass calls (by-passing done by attendant)
